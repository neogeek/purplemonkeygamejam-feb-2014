##Story

###Idea 1

You have defeated the great overlord Monstreous! You stand proud with success and look out at your great city which you have just saved, yet again. As the sun peaks over the horizon you see it. The bodies of you enemies littering your home. Will you clean up after your epic battle over evil or will you let the slowly decomposing bodies of your enemies sully you beloved city?

###Idea 2 (Dead Mario Corpses)

Mario just finished World ?-? and has run off to the next level. What happend to all the Marios and enemies that died before "that" Mario made it through? What happens if one of "those" Marios didn't actually die.
